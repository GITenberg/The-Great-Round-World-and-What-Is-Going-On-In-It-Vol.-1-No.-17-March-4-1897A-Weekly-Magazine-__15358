<p>The news from Cuba is not very encouraging.</p>

<p>The reforms promised by Spain are not believed in by the Cubans, and the
fighting is going on as fiercely as ever.</p>

<p>General Gomez, who is the head of the insurgent army, declares that Cuba
will never accept anything from Spain but absolute freedom.</p>

<p>When he took command of the Cuban army, Gomez made this a condition of his
acceptance. He did this because, years ago, when Cuba was fighting Spain,
the Spaniards offered all the reforms the people asked for, and promised
them everything they desired.</p>

<p>The Cubans believed Spain, and laid down their arms, only to find that
they had been deceived and cheated. Spain did not keep her word, and
probably never had any intention of doing so.</p>

<p>General Gomez does not mean to give her the chance of deceiving Cuba
twice.</p>

<p>The Cuban leader has issued orders to the sugar planters, forbidding them
to grind their cane, and threatening to burn their plantations if they
attempt <a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>to disobey him. He promises the planters a speedy ending to the
war, and says he is absolutely sure of the final triumph of the Cuban
arms.</p>

<p>In the mean while, he has slipped past General Weyler, who is marching
over the country, declaring it pacified.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, that in the so-called pacified country, which
lies between Weyler and Havana, the entire insurgent army is assembled and
at work.</p>

<p>In this very district that General Weyler declares to be so quiet, the
rebels are using dynamite with deadly success. They are placing bombs on
the railroad tracks, and trains are being blown up almost daily, killing
many Spanish soldiers.</p>

<p>News of encounters between the enemies is constantly being brought in.
Every day some small fight occurs that does little for the cause, but
shows that the Cubans are still unconquered.</p>

<p>General Gomez had a long talk with the representative of one of our most
reliable newspapers, and told him that he has over forty thousand soldiers
fighting for freedom, but that unfortunately he has not enough guns or
ammunition for more than half the number. He says that nearly every
soldier carries a machete, which is a weapon in use among Spanish
Americans. It is half knife, half cleaver, and is carried by the peasants
for general use upon the plantations. It makes a formidable weapon, but
is, of course, not so valuable as a rifle would be.</p>

<p>General Gomez said that if his men were only well armed, he would give
battle to Weyler, and would without doubt beat him. He declared that he
could <a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a>raise seventy-five thousand men in a month, if he only had the
means of arming them.</p>

<p>He spoke in a most determined way about the proposed reforms, and repeated
that he would take nothing from Spain but freedom. He went on to say that
the hatred of Spain was now so strong in Cuban hearts, that were the
revolution to fail, he was sure that a large majority of Cubans would
leave their homes, and go and live in a foreign country, rather than
continue under the hated rule of Spain.</p>

<p>He was asked what he thought about the way the United States was treating
Cuba.</p>

<p>This was rather a difficult question for him to answer, because he was
talking to an American; but General Gomez is a brave man, and a sincere
man, and he was not afraid to give his real opinion.</p>

<p>He said, that while he did not think that the United States was allied
with Spain to bring about the defeat of the Cubans, he thought the refusal
to recognize the Cuban government, and the assistance given to Spain to
stop filibustering, looked very much as if the United States was more
friendly to Spain than to Cuba.</p>

<p>This being the case, he said it was out of the question for the Cuban
government to listen to the advice of the United States about the reforms
that Spain offered. Cuba could not regard the United States as her friend,
and would not therefore take any suggestions from her.</p>

<p>Many people have supposed that even if the Cubans were successful, peace
would not be restored to the island. There are so many negroes and
&quot;half-breed&quot;<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a> white people among the Cubans, that the idea has got about
that the white Cubans and colored Cubans would fight each other for the
right to govern.</p>

<p>General Gomez spoke with much feeling on this point.</p>

<p>He said the colored people had borne their share in the revolution bravely
and nobly, and that there never had been, and never would be, any
distinction made between the white man and the man of African origin. All
Cubans had fought shoulder to shoulder, as brother patriots should do, and
brother patriots they would continue, white or colored.</p>

<p>Only once did General Gomez show any excitement, and that was when
Weyler's name was mentioned.</p>

<p>&quot;He is not a soldier, he is not a man, he is not a Christian!&quot; he said.
&quot;If he were a true soldier, I would respect him; if his troops were true
soldiers, I would respect them, even though they had come to hold Cuba in
chains. But he is not a soldier, nor are his men soldiers; they are here
to butcher and destroy. They think to exterminate us; but though Cuba may
weep and bleed and burn, God is with us, and the right will come at last.&quot;</p>

<p>He said that he had often thought over Weyler's cruelties, and considered
whether he should not treat the Spanish prisoners in the same way. But he
could not do so. The very thought of the cruelties ordered by Weyler, the
murdering of innocent persons, the attacking of hospitals and killing the
poor invalids, filled him with horror.</p>

<p>He said that he was determined that Cuba should shed no innocent blood in
the name of freedom.<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a></p>

<p>He was finally asked how long the war would continue, and his answer was
very short.</p>

<p>&quot;Until Cuba is free!&quot; he said</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is said that General Gomez cannot yet bear to speak about the death of
Maceo, and of his own son, who perished at the same time.</p>

<p>When the news was brought to him, he showed the true nobility of his
character.</p>

<p>Calling his soldiers together, he bade them harbor no thoughts of revenge
for the act of treachery which had cost them so brave a leader, but to
follow the example of those who had died for their country, and fight
until death or success was their portion.</p>

<p>It is said that Gomez, as a token of respect for the dead hero Maceo,
ordered his army to keep &quot;silence&quot; for ten days; which means that nearly
all of the usual noises in camp were suppressed, and stilled in mourning.</p>

<p>While Gomez is showing the true qualities of a soldier, Weyler continues
the atrocious method of warfare that more closely resembles that of the
bloodthirsty red Indian, than of a civilized Christian general.</p>

<p>He is openly in favor of ending the rebellion by killing every man, woman,
and child who is in favor of Cuban liberty. This method is called
&quot;Extermination.&quot;</p>

<p>The Marquis de Apezteguia has travelled all the way to Madrid, to tell the
Prime Minister of Spain, Se&ntilde;or Canovas, the truth about Weyler, and to beg
that he be recalled.<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a></p>

<p>He has told the Prime Minister how Weyler has been robbing the people, and
how he has made millions of dollars out of the Cuban war; that he is a
disgrace to Spain, and to the Spanish name, and that there is no chance of
the Cubans accepting terms from Spain while he is in command.</p>

<p>Weyler's treatment of the Cuban women is growing still more cruel.</p>

<p>Several Cuban ladies of rank were seized by his secret police, and without
being told what they were arrested for, were taken to prison, and put in a
cell with the lowest female prisoners.</p>

<p>After being kept in jail for twenty days, they were forced to march, with
all the criminals, through the public streets. They had to pass between
files of soldiers, the mob hooting and howling at them.</p>

<p>They were then put in box-cars, which are cars without seats, like those
we use for baggage. They travelled thus for more than twelve hours, packed
closely together with criminals of every kind, and forced to stand up all
the way.</p>

<p>On arriving at Havana, they were first thrust into jail with the men.</p>

<p>Thinking that this was perhaps a little too severe, they were removed to
the House of Refuge. This proved to be a wretched, unclean place, far
worse than the jail.</p>

<p>The correspondents for the United States papers happened to hear of the
arrival of these unfortunates, and went at once to the House of Refuge to
see them.</p>

<p>Imagine their horror when they found that one of these ladies was a
countrywoman of their own, an American citizen.<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a></p>

<p>Word was sent at once to Consul-General Fitzhugh Lee, and then the
correspondents clubbed together, and bought some beds and small comforts,
and sent them to the ladies.</p>

<p>General Lee at once tried to help the American lady, Mrs. Rodriguez, and
finally got permission for her release.</p>

<p>The other ladies said they wished they were Americans, that they might
also be helped out of their miserable position.</p>

<p>These ladies do not as yet know why they have been arrested. They all have
relatives in the insurgent army, and suppose that is the reason for their
punishment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>Three Friends</i>, the filibustering steamer that has been in so much
trouble, will soon know her fate.</p>

<p>She is to be proceeded against for piracy.</p>

<p>The officers, agents, and lawyers are not included in the new case, and so
there is no danger of any of them having to pay the penalty of piracy,
which the law says is hanging.</p>

<p>The vessel alone is the guilty party, and if her guilt is proved, she will
be confiscated, which means, taken away from her owners.</p>

<p>We spoke about the trial of the tug <i>Dauntless</i> and the <i>Three Friends</i> in
No. 14 of <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>, and told how Judge Locke had set
them at liberty, because he said that if no state of war existed in Cuba,
the tugs could not be guilty of breaking any of the laws between nations.</p>

<p>Attorney-General Harmon says that this decision of Judge Locke's makes the
<i>Three Friends</i> guilty of <a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a>piracy, for in time of peace she fired a gun on
the subjects of a friendly nation.</p>

<p>It seems that whichever way they fix it, the <i>Three Friends</i> is in
trouble.</p>

<p>The whole case rests upon the statement, made in certain New York
newspapers, that the <i>Three Friends</i> had a Hotchkiss gun in her bows, with
which she fired on the Spanish gunboat that tried to prevent her landing
her party.</p>

<p>If this statement is true, the <i>Three Friends</i> is guilty, and will have
some difficulty in escaping from justice. But it is evident that her
owners are going to deny the whole thing, and say that she had no gun on
board.</p>

<p>In Jacksonville, where she will be tried, the people are already saying
that it is foolish to suppose that there was a gun on so small a tug as
the <i>Three Friends</i>, and in Washington it is thought unlikely that it can
be proved that a gun was on the boat.</p>

<p>This makes the matter very interesting, because the New York newspapers
which published the story will not like to have it proved that they print
anything which is not true.</p>

<p>They must do everything in their power to prove that the report <i>was</i>
true, while the owners of the tug will make every effort to prove that it
was false, and only a made-up story sent by the newspaper correspondent to
give his paper an interesting item.</p>

<p>These &quot;interesting&quot; items are so frequent that people are afraid to
believe all they read in the papers.</p>

<p>It is for this very reason that we have warned our readers that it is not
safe to say &quot;such and such a thing has happened&quot; until time enough has
passed to <a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a>prove or contradict a statement; and this is the reason why we
so often say, &quot;it is said that this or that has happened.&quot; We want to be
quite sure that a thing is true before we assert it as a fact.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There may be some false report of this character at the bottom of the
trouble in Siam, which we were speaking about last week.</p>

<p>The State Department has merely filed all the papers in relation to the
outrage on Vice-Consul Kellet, and has decided to let the matter drop.</p>

<p>Consul-General Barrett sent word that the King of Siam had not taken any
notice of his demand for an inquiry into the matter; and the only reply
given him was a polite note saying that his letter had been received.</p>

<p>People who know, say that this means that the Government wishes to have
the matter dropped. Otherwise word would have been sent to Bangkok that
the Consul-General was to insist upon a proper explanation from the
Siamese government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the commander of the gunboat which was sent to Siam, has
received orders to make inquiries. He is not to do this as an official, or
on the part of the Government, but merely to find out the facts, and let
the Government know if it is necessary to take any further notice of the
affair.</p>

<p>It seems that Mr. Olney thinks that Mr. Kellet may have been to blame, and
that Mr. Barrett got excited, and made demands from the Siamese government
without first stopping to find out the truth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a>There is more trouble in Turkey, between the Turks and the Christians.</p>

<p>This time the trouble is in Crete.</p>

<p>Crete is a large island in the Grecian Archipelago, and lies just at the
foot of Greece.</p>

<p>It is a very celebrated island, and played a most important part in the
affairs of Europe when Greece was the famous empire of the world.</p>

<p>It has another claim for celebrity. It was the supposed birthplace of the
heathen god Jupiter. Jupiter was a fabulous person, of course, but the
Greeks believed in him, and declared that he was born on Mount Ida in the
island of Crete. When you grow older and read your classics, you will
learn a great deal about the heathen gods and goddesses whom the Greeks
worshipped in the days before Christianity had come to enlighten the
world.</p>

<p>Crete, in the days of Grecian glory, was one of the most famous parts of
that wonderful empire. From its favorable geographical position, it was at
one time the place through which all the arts and wonders of Asia and the
East were made known to the then rough and uncultivated Europeans.</p>

<p>People from the East, and from the West, would meet on the island of
Crete, and it became one of the most important points in Europe.</p>

<p>After many ups and downs&mdash;you should read all about them in your Grecian
history&mdash;Crete fell, with the rest of Greece, into the hands of the Turks.</p>

<p>When the Greeks fought for and gained their freedom from the Turks in
1827, Crete struggled bravely for liberty too, but she was not as
fortunate as her <a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a>sister land, and had to submit to the hated rule of the
Turk.</p>

<p>The Cretans are Greeks and Christians, and long to be under the rule of a
Christian monarch.</p>

<p>In 1869 they made another struggle for freedom, and appealed to the powers
of Europe to free them.</p>

<p>They asked to be allowed to join themselves to Greece, or else to be given
liberty, under the protection of some Christian country.</p>

<p>But they got no help, and the Turks still ruled in Crete.</p>

<p>The present outbreak is but a renewal of the old feud. The recent murders
of Christians in Armenia have made the Christians in Crete restless, and
they are determined to make one more effort for freedom.</p>

<p>The Greeks are anxious to aid the Cretans, and at the first word of the
revolt in Crete sent war-ships to Canea, the port at which the fighting
has taken place.</p>

<p>The revolt appears to have been well planned, for the main cities of the
island were soon in the possession of the Cretans, who only waited a
signal from Greece to declare a union with that country, and to overthrow
the rule of Turkey.</p>

<p>The signal seems not to have been long in coming, for, if the news can be
believed, the union of Crete and Greece has already been proclaimed.</p>

<p>This will probably mean a war between Greece and Turkey; indeed, it seems
impossible that war can be prevented, for Turkey is not going to sit
quietly down and allow her possessions to be taken from her.</p>

<p>There is a report that a Greek ship entered Canea, the port of Crete, and
did not salute the Turkish flag. This looks very like war.<a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></p>

<p>It is the custom for every vessel on entering a foreign port to salute the
flag of that port, and a failure to do so is considered a very grave
insult.</p>

<p>The latest news seems very serious indeed, almost as if this Cretan matter
were going to bring about the European war that has been so long feared.</p>

<p>Russia has suddenly become very indignant with England, declaring that she
has stirred up this Cretan trouble, so that, in the confusion that will
follow, she may be able to secure some important ports in the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>The Russians have ranged themselves on the side of Turkey, and insist that
the only way for peace to be restored in Crete is for Russian and French
war-ships to occupy the ports, and force the people back into quiet.</p>

<p>England will not submit to anything of this sort, and if Russia and France
take such action, war is bound to follow.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that a war with Turkey is going to be an easy
thing.</p>

<p>The Turkish soldiers are a fine, well-drilled body of men; indeed, the
English Minister to Greece stated that the Turkish soldiers were the
finest he had ever seen.</p>

<p>The Janizaries, the most famous regiment of soldiers in the world, are the
body-guard of the Sultan of Turkey.</p>

<p>Not only are they well-drilled and powerful men, but they fight absolutely
without fear. A Turkish soldier will never run away&mdash;he fights till he
conquers or dies. This is due to his religion, which teaches him that what
is to be will be, and that if it is his <a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a>fate to be killed he will be
killed, whether he runs away or stays in the battle.</p>

<p>So he stays&mdash;and does all the harm he can before his fate, whatever it may
be, overtakes him.</p>

<p>It is also his belief that if he is killed in battle his sins are forgiven
him, and he will go straight to Paradise; so he has no fear of the fight,
and makes a very stubborn and dangerous foe.</p>

<p>In the mean while, the Sultan of Turkey has a little business of his own
on hand.</p>

<p>He is very much annoyed at the length of the conference of the Powers
about the reforms he is to be asked to make.</p>

<p>All the dead walls of Constantinople, where the Ambassadors are meeting,
have been covered with placards and posters of a character to enrage the
common people, and make them turn their thoughts to fresh massacres.</p>

<p>It is said on good authority, that the placards come from the Sultan, and
have been posted by his orders.</p>

<p>It is also said that he hopes to provoke the people and cause fresh
rioting, and so break up the conference which so much annoys him.</p>

<p>Another massacre may be expected any moment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a movement on foot in New York, to prevent any more of the very
high buildings being put up.</p>

<p>It seems that no one has any idea of the danger from high buildings.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade and Transportation, which is trying to get a bill
passed in Albany, preventing any <a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a>further work of this sort being done,
asked the Chief of the Fire Department to come before it and give his
opinion of these high structures.</p>

<p>He told the committee, that at the present time the Fire Department could
not fight a fire in any of these tall buildings. He said that none of the
engines owned by the department could throw a stream of water higher than
125 feet from the ground, and that all floors over that height would have
to be left to burn.</p>

<p>All the very high buildings are supposed to be fire proof, and Chief
Bonner was asked what he thought about them. He laughed, and said there
was no such thing as a fire-proof building, and that in fact the
iron-framed structures, supposed to be fire-proof, were perhaps a little
more dangerous than the old style of brick building. He said that these
frames become heated and bend, pulling the walls down, so that they fall
much more quickly than they used to, and make the firemen's work more
difficult.</p>

<p>The only absolutely fire-proof building that he knew of was the Public
Library in Boston, where there was no wood at all used in the
building&mdash;the doors and window frames even being of iron. He was sure that
so long as wood was used in the construction of any part of a building, it
was quite impossible to call it fire-proof.</p>

<p>Several architects were asked to give their opinions, and also some
engineers who had made a study of the laws of health.</p>

<p>These men were all agreed that high buildings were unsanitary&mdash;which means
bad for the health&mdash;and that they made all the lower buildings around them
<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a>unsanitary too, by shutting off the light and air, and making them dark,
and inclined to be damp.</p>

<p>The general opinion was so much against these &quot;sky-scrapers&quot; that the
Board of Trade and Transportation decided to send a bill to the
Legislature in Albany, praying that the erection of such dangerous
buildings might be stopped.</p>

<p>They ask that no structure may be higher than 165 feet. This will allow
for twelve and thirteen stories. It was proposed to run up some offices
that would be twenty-two stories high, and it was this that frightened
people into action on the subject.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade and Transportation does some very good work for the
citizens of New York.</p>

<p>It is made up of men who have large business interests in the city, and
they watch all the bills that are sent up to Albany, and all the work done
by the Mayor and Aldermen, and take notice of every part of the city's
government, to make sure that the best interests of the citizens are being
cared for.</p>

<p>This Board is of the greatest service to all New Yorkers. The business
interests of a city demand that all the roads shall be kept in good
repair, that the ways of reaching the city shall be many and easy, and
that the fares shall not be too high.</p>

<p>Over all these matters, and a great many more which we have not space to
write about, the Board of Trade and Transportation watches faithfully and
untiringly.</p>

<p>There was a meeting of the George Junior Republic Association the other
day. Many interesting things were spoken of in regard to the settlement at
Freeville.<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a></p>

<p>You may not perhaps know what a wonderful association this Republic is.</p>

<p>The Junior Republic was started in 1890 by Mr. William R. George.</p>

<p>This kind-hearted man read a story in a newspaper, about a ragged boy in
City Hall Park, eagerly watching a little yellow spot on the grass which
he hoped was a dandelion. It told how, after a weary waiting until the
policeman's back was turned, the boy dashed under the forbidden rail,
stooped for the prize, only to find that it was a bit of orange peel.</p>

<p>Mr. George was touched by the story of the boy's disappointment; the more
he thought of it, and of the longing of a city child for the trees and
flowers of the country, the more he grieved that so many little ones never
had a chance of seeing the green fields, and enjoying the wonders of
Nature.</p>

<p>The result of it all was, that Mr. George collected twenty-two poor little
ragged lads, and gave them a two weeks' outing at Freeville that summer.</p>

<p>From this beginning, the whole wonderful plan of the Republic shaped
itself in his mind.</p>

<p>He thought that if he could get hold of the rough children of the streets,
who have no kind parents to care for them, and use the summer holiday to
influence them to good actions, he would be doing a great work for them.</p>

<p>He felt that the best way to bring this about was to put them in a
miniature world of their own, where they would have the same trials and
temptations as in their city homes, but with the advantage of having some
one at hand to show them the right way.</p>

<p>His plan was to form a genuine republic, to which <a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>boys and girls would
be equally welcome as citizens. The plan has been carried out, and the
Junior Republic is a great success.</p>

<p>It is an absolute republic, with a government like our own. It has its
President, its Senators and Congressmen, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. George is the President; the boy and girl citizens form the Congress,
the Cabinet officers, the Judge, and the police.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States, and the laws of New York State, are
followed as closely as possible, and other laws are made to regulate the
particular needs of the Republic.</p>

<p>All citizens, boys and girls, are required to work. Nothing is given away
in Freeville. The young citizens are paid for their work, and have to
support themselves on their earnings.</p>

<p>The boys and girls who will not work get no food.</p>

<p>In all large cities and communities, the people who have money are obliged
to pay a certain sum to help others who have none. Therefore men and women
who do not work because they are old or ill, are provided with food and
shelter from the money, or taxes, that the well-to-do have to pay.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/21.jpg"><img src="./images/21-tb.jpg" alt="Street Sweeper, The Farming Class, A Member of the Cooking Class" title="Street Sweeper, The Farming Class, A Member of the Cooking Class" /></a></p>


<p>In Freeville it is different. All the citizens are young and healthy, and
able to work, so a law has been passed that no laws shall be made to raise
money to keep the idle. No money is set aside to keep paupers, and those
who do not work cannot eat. The result is, that there are no paupers or
tramps in Freeville.</p>

<p>The way the children earn their money, is by working from eight-thirty
till noon every day at farming, <a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a>landscape gardening, carpentry, cooking,
millinery, and sewing.</p>

<p>They are paid according to their skill, and are divided into three grades;
unskilled, medium, and skilled labor.</p>

<p>The children naturally try their best to improve, so that they may get
higher wages, and thus they gradually progress, and learn their trades.</p>

<p>They are paid every Saturday, like regular laborers, and out of the money
they earn, they pay for their board and lodging through the week.</p>

<p>There is a bank in which the thrifty can put their savings, and when they
go back to the city they draw these savings out.</p>

<p>The money used is not regular money, but Freeville money, made of
cardboard, and at the end of the holiday the children are not given United
States money for their savings, but the value of their little hoard in
vegetables, fruit, and clothing.</p>

<p>This summer outing teaches the rough boys of the city what their duties in
life are, and shows them, better than words could do, that the boy or man
who wants to be happy must work honestly and obey the law.</p>

<p>Freeville has its boy policemen, who arrest all evildoers; its jail, where
the offenders are locked up; and its gang of convicts, who are only given
bread and water, and prison fare, and are kept at work the whole day,
instead of from eight-thirty till noon.</p>

<p>The records of the Republic show that boys who have gone into Freeville
rough and bad, and have commenced their citizenship with idling and
thieving, have in a few weeks become law-abiding citizens.<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a></p>

<p>So successful has this summer Republic been, that Mr. George has made up
his mind to keep it going the whole year round.</p>

<p>Over two hundred children were housed there last summer, and thirty-four
boys are passing the winter there.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of some wealthy people, a farm of forty-eight acres
has been bought for the Republic, and this spring and summer it is
intended to make room for a much greater number of &quot;citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>The Republic is supported by subscriptions, and the treasurer wants to
raise ten thousand dollars, to carry out the many fine ideas Mr. George
has in mind for this summer.</p>

<p>England, Germany, and Japan have made inquiries into the work at
Freeville, and Mr. George hopes that republics may be started in other
countries.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Illinois are starting republics of their
own, and Mr. George has had word from the Junior Republic of California,
that the plan is in working order there, and doing exceedingly well.</p>

<h2>THE SCHUBERT CENTENNIAL.</h2>


<p>A Schubert celebration was held in Vienna on the hundredth anniversary of
the great composer's birth, which occurred on January 31st.</p>

<p>Concerts of Schubert music were given, and an exhibition of his
manuscripts and letters.</p>

<p>An old battered piano which he had used was also shown. This is the only
article which belonged to him that is known to exist, as he died in
extreme poverty. It seems sad that his genius was not properly appreciated
until after his death, and that he who was to give so much to the world of
music should have been denied all but the barest necessities.</p>

<p>We publish an account of his life, written especially for <span class='smcap'>The Great
Round World</span>.<br /><br /></p>


<p class='center'><span class='smcap'>Franz Schubert.</span></p>

<p>Eighteen hundred and ninety-seven is the centennial year of Franz
Schubert, the great composer, who was born in Vienna on the 31st of
January, 1797. He was of humble lineage. His father, who also bore the
name of Franz, was the son of a peasant, who studied in Vienna, and became
assistant to his brother, a schoolmaster. He married Elizabeth Vitz, who
had been in service as a cook in Vienna. Franz Peter Schubert was the
thirteenth of a family of fourteen children, nine of whom died in infancy.
His love of music was apparent when he was very young. A relative often
took him to visit a pianoforte warehouse, and there, and on an old
worn-out piano at home, the child studied his first exercises without a
master. At the age of <a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a>seven he had a teacher, Michael Holzer, who used to
cry out, &quot;When I wish to teach him anything, he always knows it already.&quot;
When he was eleven years old he was employed as a solo singer and violin
player in a church. A little later his father succeeded in getting him a
position in the Emperor's Chapel, and he thus became a pupil in a music
school, which was called the &quot;Convict.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that the boys at the Convict endured many privations. The
practice-room was unbearably cold in winter, and the young students were
allowed to go without food for eight hours and a half, between a &quot;poor
dinner and a wretched supper.&quot; When he was about fifteen, Franz wrote to
his brother, explaining his position, his hungry longing for a roll or an
apple, and concluded in these words: &quot;I rely on the teaching of the
Apostle Matthew, who says, 'Let him that hath two coats give one to the
poor.' Meanwhile I trust you will listen to the voice which unceasingly
appeals to you to remember your loving, hoping, poverty-stricken&mdash;and once
again I repeat poverty-stricken&mdash;brother Franz.&quot;</p>

<p>His earliest composition for the piano is dated April, 1810. It was his
habit to date all his pieces. In March, 1811, he composed a long vocal
piece, &quot;Hagar's Lament over Her Dying Son.&quot; His boy friends at the Convict
were devoted to him, and were eager to play, sing, or copy any of his
compositions. One of them, Josef Spaun, who was several years older than
Schubert, and better off, helped him to procure all the music paper he
needed.</p>

<p>His first mass, in F, was composed and performed in 1814. It is said to be
the most remarkable first <a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a>mass ever produced, excepting Beethoven's in C.
In 1815, when he was only eighteen years old, he composed the music for
more than a hundred songs. The fine song, the &quot;Erl King,&quot; was written in
this year, and many of his boyish songs are among his finest productions.
When he died in 1828, he left more than 1,100 compositions, the greater
number of which had not then been published.</p>

<p>In his lifetime, some of his songs were sold for a few pence, and he lived
in poverty nearly all his days. Yet publishers have grown rich by the sale
of his compositions, and his work is a delight to the world. The house in
which he was born is marked by a marble tablet, and costly memorials have
been raised in his honor. Some words that he spoke in the delirium of his
last illness made his brother Ferdinand believe that he wished to be
buried near Beethoven. This wish was fulfilled, and his grave lies near
that of the great musician, for whom from his early boyhood he always had
a profound reverence and admiration.</p>

<h2>INVENTION AND DISCOVERY.</h2>


<p>There has lately been patented in England a system for making buttons,
combs, brush-handles, billiard balls, and such like articles out of milk.</p>

<p>The bone buttons and articles of that kind, which we have been using up to
the present time, have been made of refuse from the slaughter-houses. This
new process will only require milk.</p>

<p>Any one who knows anything about dairy work knows what loppered milk is.
It is the thick soured milk that one finds under the butter cream.</p>

<p>This loppered milk is made into cottage cheese, and many people, in making
their cottage cheese, stand it for a moment on the fire to thicken.</p>

<p>Woe to the dairy wife who lets it stay too long!</p>

<p>It becomes like little knobs of rubber, that nothing will soften. When one
tries to bite it one's teeth rebound. It is the toughest kind of material.</p>

<p>Mr. Callander, the Englishman who invented the milk buttons, must have had
an encounter with some of this cottage cheese, and his trouble in chewing
it must have made him wonder whether it wasn't intended for something else
instead of food.</p>

<p>He has found a means of making the loppered milk so solid, that three days
after he has mixed it with some ingredients, the secret of which he will
not tell, it is like celluloid, and is ready to be cut.</p>

<p>It has a glossy surface, and is of a creamy color.</p>

<p>It is said to be less brittle than bone or celluloid, and not likely to
chip. Any one who has eaten cottage cheese that has been too long on the
stove will believe that the new substance has powers of resistance that
are quite unequalled.</p>

<p>The Editor is pleased to acknowledge the letters from John Russell and

by them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to answer Fred's inquiry, as to where we get our news. The
only true answer is, from all over and everywhere. The Editor has eyes and
ears open all the while to gather interesting facts for the paper's young
readers.</p>

<p>The Editor was pleased to receive the pleasant letter from I.L.G. Rice.
The suggestion of an article on &quot;Casting and Founding&quot; is good, and will
be adopted at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>I.L.G. Rice must, however, bear in mind that expansion is thoroughly
understood by scientists, and that Dr. Moissan was not doing the rough
work of a foundry, but conducting a most delicate experiment, in which he
brought into play all the scientific knowledge available.</p>

<p>In reply to your letter about the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>It is only arranged to save people climbing up-stairs. It is easy enough
to go down-stairs, but it is the climbing up that people dislike, and the
new elevator is to save this trouble.</p>

<p>It will take up three thousand passengers an hour, and if it is the
success it promises to be, six of these lazy-man's staircases will be put
into use.</p>

<p>It is the same size as the staircase of which it is to take the place.<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a></p>

<p>John Jackson, the originator of this system of vertical writing, is the
only teacher who has had the years of practice in teaching it that make
these the standard manuals for teachers and students. The adoption of
vertical writing abroad and in this country is largely due to his
persistent work and the marvellous results of his teaching. His series of
copy-books were the first to be used in this country, and are considered
by experienced teachers, who are not to be misled by mere beauty of
engravers work, to contain the only practical well-graded course of
instruction leading from primary work to the rapid and now justly
celebrated <b>telegraph hand</b>&mdash;for these books are the only ones containing
copies in this rapid writing. The telegraph hand is the style used by the
best telegraph operators in the country&mdash;and these writers are universally
acknowledged to be the most rapid writers, and writers of a hand which of
necessity must be most legible.</p>

<h2>SIMPLE LESSONS IN THE</h2>

<h2>STUDY OF NATURE</h2>

<h3>By I.G. OAKLEY</h3>


<p>This is a handy little book, which many a teacher who is looking for means
to offer children genuine nature study may be thankful to get hold of.</p>

<p>Nature lessons, to be entitled to that name, must deal with what can be
handled and scrutinized at leisure by the child, pulled apart, and even
wasted. This can be done with the objects discussed in this book; they are
under the feet of childhood&mdash;grass, feathers, a fallen leaf, a budding
twig, or twisted shell; these things cannot be far out of the way, even
within the stony limits of a city.</p>

<p>Nor are the lessons haphazard dashes at the nearest living thing; on the
contrary, they are virtually fundamental, whether with respect to their
relation to some of the classified sciences, or with reference to the
development of thought and power of expression in the child himself.</p>

<p>The illustrations are few, and scarcely more than figures; it is not meant
to be a pretty picture-book, yet is most clearly and beautifully printed
and arranged, for its material is to be that out of which pictures are
made. It will be found full of suggestions of practical value to teachers
who are carrying the miscellaneous work of ungraded schools, and who have
the unspeakable privilege of dealing with their pupils untrammelled by
cast-iron methods and account-keeping examination records.</p>

<p>&quot;I would advise <b>Sunday-school teachers</b> to use, in connection with the
lessons of 1897, <b>Klemm's Relief Map of the Roman Empire</b>. Every scholar
who can draw should have a copy of it. Being blank, it can be beautifully
colored: waters, blue; mountains, brown; valleys, green; deserts, yellow;
cities marked with pin-holes; and the journeys of Paul can be traced upon
it.&quot;&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Mrs. Wilbur F. Crafts</span>, <i>President International Union of

<p class='center'><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE MAPS.</b></p>

<p>These maps are made in two forms, both with beautifully executed relief
(embossed)&mdash;the cheaper ones of plain stiff paper similar to drawing paper
(these are to be substituted for and used as outline map blanks), the
others covered with a durable waterproof surface, that can be quickly
cleaned with a damp sponge, adapted to receive a succession of markings
and cleansings. Oceans, lakes, and rivers, as well as land, appear in the
same color, white, so as to facilitate the use of the map as a
<b><i>geographical slate</i></b>.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the beautiful colors in a fly's wing? or the hole
through a hair, or the little seed babies in the different seeds? Probably
not unless you have some extra eyes to see them with. We call these EXTRA
EYES, MICROSCOPES, Microscope is a name made from two Greek words, MICROS,
&quot;small,&quot; and SKOPEIN, &quot;to view,&quot; and is an instrument to look at small
things.</p>

<p>A very nice one is shown in the following picture; it has glass plates to
put these small things on, a mirror to reflect the light under them, and
all of the little instruments necessary. The price is $2.00, and this
covers the entire cost of a nice strong box with a place for each part,
which will be sent to any address for this price.</p>

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
